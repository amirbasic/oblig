- [Minimal solution for Obligatory 2](https://github.uio.no/in5550/2023/tree/main/obligatories/2/minimal_solution)
- Sentiment analysis with fine-tuned BERT


# TODO:
- Implement the remaining parts of the `bert_classification.py` script:
- sentiment predictions on arbitrary sentences
- fine-tuning with unfrozen model weights
- try a different BERT model (for example, am multilingual BERT?)
- Fill in the row with your username in the [Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fU1Lzc2YlfjlwHcf_pxZu6-vQPNmRzTVFaI3rmu8wL8/edit?usp=sharing) with your results
